## Inspired by

To add keycloak authentication in this angular keycloak app, I read the following blog post:

[Connecting Keycloak to Angular](https://medium.com/@blained3/connecting-keycloak-to-angular-d175c92a0dd3)

Especially 'part 3: Connecting Angular' explains in a basic way how to introduce keycloak authentication in an angular app.

Blog post [Integrating Keycloak with an Angular 4 Web Application â€“ Part 6](https://symbiotics.co.za/integrating-keycloak-with-an-angular-4-web-application-part-6/)
helped me to integrate the keycloak logout functionality.
